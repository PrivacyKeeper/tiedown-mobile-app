// The run-ending rules, as data the app can render.
//
// This is a one-line adapter and it exists for a reason worth stating: the
// rules screen must not be a second copy of the rulebook. It reads the SAME
// table the scoring engine applies, so the app cannot tell somebody one thing
// and score them by another. Add a penalty to the engine and it appears here;
// there is nowhere to forget.
//
// Every app's table is named for its event (TD_PENALTIES), which is why this file
// is per-app and the screen that reads it is not.
